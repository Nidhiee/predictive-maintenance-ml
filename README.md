# Predictive Maintenance for Industrial Machines

## Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict industrial machine failures using sensor data such as temperature, torque, rotational speed, and tool wear.

## Problem Statement
Unexpected machine breakdowns lead to production loss and increased maintenance costs. This project aims to predict machine failures in advance to enable proactive maintenance.

## Dataset
AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance Dataset (Kaggle)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Random Forest Classifier

## Project Workflow
1. Load and preprocess sensor data
2. Select relevant features
3. Train a machine learning model
4. Predict machine failure
5. Evaluate model performance
