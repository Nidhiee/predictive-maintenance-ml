# Predictive Maintenance for Industrial Machines

## Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict industrial machine failures using sensor data such as temperature, torque, rotational speed, and tool wear.

## Problem Statement
Unexpected machine breakdowns lead to production loss and increased maintenance costs. This project aims to predict machine failures in advance to enable proactive maintenance.
